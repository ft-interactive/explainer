Explainer
=========

## Usage


1. **Export the audio** from Audition as both **.mp3 and .oga (ogg)** formats. It helps if both files have the same name.
2. Put the **audio** files **in** your **animation's folder**.
3. In Edge, open the **code window** ( &#8984;E ). Then click the _Stage_ item in the menu on left.
4. **Paste** the Javascript **snippet** below into the code window.
5. Ensure that **paths** to audio files **is correct - no need for the file extension**. The one below might not be quite right for you.
6. Use the correct width parameter. `'wide'` or `'narrow'` are your options. See below.
7. Edit the explainer's html file. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/explainer.min.css">` to the `<head>` of the HTML generated by Edge. This ensures styles are loaded immediately. Again, ensure the URL is correct.
8. Add the fallback message in conditional tags  just inside the body tag. An example of this is below.


**Javscript Snippet for pasting into the Stage section of the Edge Code window:**

```javascript
    
    var version = '0.0.2';
    
    Edge.yepnope({
        load: [
            '../lib/'+ version +'/explainer-'+ version +'.min.js'
        ],
        callback: function(){
            IG.Explainer.create(compId, 'audiofilename', version, 'wide');
        }
    });
```


**HTML fallback message example:**


```html
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
       <div id="fallback" class="fallback fallback-overlay">
            <div class="fallback-msg">
             <p>Sorry, your internet browser does not support
             the technology used in this interactive graphic. Most likely you
             are using an older version of Internet Explorer.</p>
             <p>Please either upgrade to
             Internet Explorer 9, or view this interactive graphic in another browser such as
             Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari or Opera.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <![endif]-->            
```

You may also like to try using Grunt to package (minify JavaScript files etc) the Explainer before publishing it. :-)

## Troubleshooting

**Adobe Audition doesn't let me export as .oga format. What should I do?**

You can export as an 'ogg' file and then manually change the the file extension to 'oga'.

**What standard settings do I need to use in Adobe Edge?** 

**Normal (Wide)**

* Stage Width = `792px`
* Stage Height = `600px`

**Narrow**

* Stage Width = `600px`
* Stage Height = `400px`

**All**

* Stage Background colour = `#FFF1E0`
* Autoplay = false (unchecked)
* Set the Composition Name e.g. _My Explainer_
* Set the `Composition ID`. e.g. `my_explainer_animation`
* **Fonts in Edge? How do we do this?**

**What should the Methode iFrame code look like?**


**Wide**


```html

    <iframe src="http://interactive.ftdata.co.uk/path/to/explainer" width="792px" height="650px"></iframe>

```

**Narrow**


```html

    <iframe src="http://interactive.ftdata.co.uk/path/to/explainer" width="600px" height="450px"></iframe>

```

## Hacking the Explainer library

We use the following libs and tools.

* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com) provided by Edge
* [Yepnope](http://yepnopejs.com/) provided by Edge and aliased as `window.AdobeEdge.yepnope`
* [jPlayer](http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide) to handle the audio including 'fall back' shim to Flash audio.
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for icons - Play, pause etc.
* [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md) for preparing the distribution package


**Getting started**
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/ft-interactive/explainer.git
	$ cd explainer
	$ npm install
	$ grunt --help
	

**Create a distribution package**
	
	$ grunt dist
	
 
**Create a release package**

	$ grunt release
	
	
**Notes**

You'll need to serve the code out of a **webserver** that is set up to do the following:

* send proper caching headers (because Yepnope is used)
* sets the correct `Content-Type` on mp3, ogg, oga audio files
* supports `Accept-Ranges:bytes` on the response headers of audio files
